# Leaflet.LayerViewer

A UI framework for showing multiple layers in Leaflet.js, essentially a wrapper to Leaflet which integrates various plugins into a full map UI.

Originally written for the [CycleStreets Bikedata](https://github.com/cyclestreets/bikedata/) project.

Layers and settings are defined using a simple, high-level, declarative structure.
